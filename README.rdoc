== Phantom Proxy - A webkit proxy
The phantom proxy acts as a http proxy server. It fetches the remote webpages
with the help phantomjs (see http://www.phantomjs.org/ ).

You can use this to get a page after the javascipt execution. By setting some HTTP
headers you can get the page with all iframes included or as an image.

== Installation
Install phanotmjs (see: http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/BuildInstruction, http://phantomjs.org/download.html)

On Debian:

 sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev libqtwebkit-dev qt4-qmake
 cd phantom
 git clone https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs.git
 git checkout 1.2
 qmake-qt4 && make

 checkout phantom_proxy

 gem build phantom_proxy.gemspec

 gem install phantom_proxy-*.gem

== Usage
Run
 phantom_proxy
either with -self (ip, port) to not use the thin::runner framework
or
with any thin parameter you want (e.g. -p 8080).

Point your browser's proxy to http://localhost:8080 for testting.

You can use the Net::HTTP lib to fetch page or use the phantom_client
(see: https://github.com/experteer/phantom_client).

Monitoring(1.1.0):
The phantom_proxy comes with a usage monitor.
You can see the current proxy status by pointing your browser to
	phantom_proxy_control_panel
if you have set the proxy or just to the address and port the proxy is running at
	address:port/phantom_proxy_control_panel

Security(1.2.0)
Now the phantom_proxy can be secured with a key. The system is implemented with an hmac algorithm.
Simply supply "-hmac THE_KEY" when starting the proxy and the proxy is secured

Service script(1.2.1)
In lib/phantom_proxy/install you can find an init.d script which makes it pretty easy to use phantom_proxy as a service with variable configured instances.
A howto on the config of the services can be found in the init script.

Service script(1.2.10)
Added an example script fixed alot of bugs from previous versions
To succesfully run the service you have to create the following directories and files
mkdir /etc/phantom_proxy
mkdir /etc/phantom_proxy/config or place a config file there
If you created config as a directory place your config files in there. In the install dir you find an example script for this.

Inside phproxy you have to set PP_USER_STANDARD and PP_USER to the user you want to run the as or set this variable inside the proxy script.

Phantomjs2.1.1(1.4.0)
The proxy now neew phantomjs 2.1.1
